# CloudSpokes (on Rails!)

This application is not a pixel-for-pixel or same-HTML remake of
Cloudspokes. This was an intentional decision as it has been built with
the same look and feel but using semantic HTML5 as well as Sprockets,
SASS, and CSS3.

The application is on a clean skeleton and is set up for RSpec testing.
To run the application, you can simply run `rails server`. It is also
complete with a Gemfile, Guardfile for test automation, and more.

Basically this is a shell application that gives you everything you need
to get up and running. It should deploy to Heroku great as-is.
